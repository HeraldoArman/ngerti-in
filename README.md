# Ngerti.in - Your Personal AI Study Tutor ü§ñ

**GarudaHacks 6.0 Hackathon - 3rd Place Winner (Education & Equity Track)**

Ngerti.in is an innovative AI-powered learning platform designed to provide personalized and interactive learning experiences. This platform connects students with AI tutors for various subjects, facilitating engaging and effective learning sessions through real-time voice integration and interactive whiteboard explanations.

## üöÄ Background & Inspiration

Have you ever struggled to understand a lecture in class? Or hesitated to ask questions for fear of being judged? You‚Äôre not alone. Many students worldwide face similar challenges. According to UNESCO, over 600 million people lack minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, highlighting that the issue isn't just about access but also the methods of studying.

We believe learning should be an active, engaging dialogue, not a passive, one-way experience. [cite: 5] [cite\_start]What if you had a non-judgmental tutor available 24/7 to help you understand complex topics?  With the advancements in AI, we saw an opportunity to create a tool that allows students to learn anytime and anywhere, in real-time. [cite\_start]Ngerti.in was built to be that listening, responsive, and guiding learning companion.

### Pain Points Addressed:

  * Lack of access to quality education.
  * Difficulty understanding classroom lectures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

  * Node.js (v18 or higher is recommended)
  * npm or yarn
  * ngrok

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/heraldoarman/ngerti-in.git
    cd ngerti-in
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Run the following command to install all the required packages.

    ```sh
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory by copying from `.env.example` (if it exists) or creating it from scratch. Fill in all the necessary credentials.

    ```env
    # You will get this URL from ngrok in a later step
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=""

    # Database, Authentication, and other Service Credentials
    DATABASE_URL=""
    BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=""
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_VIDEO_API_KEY=""
    STREAM_VIDEO_SECRET=""
    OPENAI_API_KEY=""
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_CHAT_API_KEY=""
    STREAM_CHAT_SECRET_KEY=""
    ```

4.  **Sync the Database**
    After filling in the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file, run the following script to sync your database schema using Drizzle Kit.

    ```sh
    npm run db:push
    ```

5.  **Run Background Services**
    Open **two new terminals** to run Inngest and ngrok separately.

      * **In Terminal 1 (Inngest):**
        Run the Inngest dev server to handle background jobs and events.

        ```sh
        npm run dev:inngest
        ```

      * **In Terminal 2 (Ngrok):**
        Run ngrok to expose your local server to the internet, which is required for webhooks to function correctly.

        ```sh
        ngrok http 3000
        ```

        Once this command is running, **copy the forwarding URL** provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok-free.app`) and **paste it** as the value for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` variable in your `.env` file.

6.  **Run the Main Development Server**
    Return to your main terminal and run the Next.js development server with Turbopack.

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

7.  **Open the Application**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. Your application is now running locally\!
